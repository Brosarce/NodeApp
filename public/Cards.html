<h3>America</h3>
<p>America has a high attack and defence stat, but only against other land or air units, it has a weak power on the water but can really slam down opponents in the air or land.</p>
<p>America has an ego as large as its attack, and its ego grows with every enemy fallen by its hand by +1.</p>

<h3>Russia</h3>
<p>Russia has a strong defence stat but lacks in attack unless on the water, where it gets the upper hand in a battle against America.</p>
<p>Russia goes into Winter mode every one in four turns when its defence is increased so high any contesting power that chooses to attack it during Winter mode will lose half its health.</p>

<h3>Germany</h3>
<p>Germany has a very strong land force and specializes in that, but has low defence due to a low naval and air power.</p>
<p>Although weak in defence Germany can still hit full force with its special perk "Advanced Weaponry", allowing Germany to overpower even America and its soldiers.</p>
