<h1>How to play Polandball OCG<h1>
	<p>Polandball OCG is a small Online Card Game (OCG) that uses the different continents with their own abilities for their own power to fight and defeat their enemies.</p>
<h2>What you need to know to play this game.</h2>
	<p>There are a lot of different kinds of cards that could be put into the game, but with my limited time I will (for now) only throw in a couple of different cards. We'll start off with America, our first card, is very heavy in attack and health, but is only effective on land type cards. Whereas England is especially effective against water type cards due to its strong naval force. There are many different types that will be talked about farther in the page.</p>
